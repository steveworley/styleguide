drupal?

one page app?

local storage first, indexedDB

a component could have multiple states: hover, active, inactive, edit, display-only
these states could be stored in a "sub view"
we could provide a "live" view of the component


store versions of each component (changes to html/style)
allow commenting on a component (users can submit potential updates)
store where this component can be found on the live site at the moment (this could update live)
	poll the live page via ajax and check if the HTML is found
